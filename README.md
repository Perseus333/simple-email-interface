# simple-email-interface
A email interface, using the tkinter messageboxes and smtplib to send the emails.
You will have a set email with your passoword and you will have to make sure that you have replaced the text in email.txt porperly to work.
Also, the email.txt and the email_interface.py will have to be in the same folder.
To send an email you will have to execute the email_interface.py and write his email direction and then the message that you would like to send.
This can make a huge improvement of speed when you have to only write simple text messages and you do not have your email website or app opened.
This is specially useful in Outlook that has many problems loading its web interface.
